open and keep docker app
open command prompt (server side) and write the command -> "docker run hello-world" => ouputs "Hello from Docker!"
go to docker hub on browser -> go to https://hub.docker.com/ -> search for mysql -> to pull we get a command. Type that command "docker run mysql" on gitbash
go to the first command prompt and type "docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pswd -d mysql"
-> you'll get "ac9137eaa58c24d4fb5e5d07e070fea47443413adfbb41fdf950d74a64521129"

open a command prompt (client command prompt) and type the command "docker run -it mysql /bin/bash" -> outputs "bash-4.4#"
open another command prompt and give the command "docker container ls" => shows whatever containers were running in the section. 
choose any of the containers and copy the name. typpe the command -> "docker inspect container_name" => this is being done to get the ip address of that container
in the output, copy the IP address (here, 172.17.0.2) and go to client command prompt and paste it after the bash display -> "bash-4.4# mysql -h 172.17.0.2 -u root -p"
enter the password as pswd (refer 4th line) -> outputs "welcome to the sql mmonitor"
enter the command "create database db;" -> outputs "1 row effected"
enter the command "show schemas;" -> outputs the database
